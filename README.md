# Airbnb Seasonality Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb booking patterns to uncover **seasonal demand trends** and identify factors driving occupancy rates across different listing types, price points, and neighborhoods in New York City.

**Goal:** Understand when demand peaks, which listings succeed during off-seasons, and how booking flexibility affects success.

## üìã Datasets Used
- **Source:** Airbnb Open Data (Kaggle)
- **Location:** New York City
- **Records:** 50,530 listings (after cleaning)
- **Date Range:** 2012-08-25 to 2025-06-26 (13 years of historical data)
- **Key Metric:** `reviews_per_month` (proxy for booking frequency/demand)

## üîÑ Project Stages & Progress

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: Data Collection
- Loaded Airbnb dataset with 102,599 rows and 27 columns
- Documented data origin and structure
- Initial exploratory checks completed

### ‚úÖ Stage 2: Data Cleaning ([01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb](01_Data_Cleaning.ipynb))
**Tasks Performed:**
- Removed null values in critical columns (last_review, id, name, host_id)
- Corrected data types: converted price/service_fee to numeric, dates to datetime
- Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)
- Validated and corrected data ranges:
  - minimum_nights: 1-365 days
  - availability_365: 0-365 days
  - price: $50-$1,200
  - reviews_per_month: 0-25.23
- Removed 35,987 rows (41.5%) with outliers/impossible values
- Final clean dataset: **50,530 rows**

### ‚úÖ Stage 4: Feature Engineering ([02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb](02_Feature_Engineering.ipynb))
**Features Created (18 total):**

**Time-Based Features (8):**
- `year`, `month`, `quarter`, `day_of_week`, `day_name`, `week_of_year`
- `is_weekend` (binary flag)
- `is_peak_season` (binary flag for summer/december)

**Seasonality Indicators (1):**
- `season` (Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall)

**Demand Indicators (4):**
- `review_frequency_category` (Low/Medium/High/Very High)
- `availability_category` (Very Low/Low/Medium/High)
- `demand_score` (0-100 percentile scale)
- `demand_level` (Low/Medium/High/Very High)

**Price Features (3):**
- `price_tier` (Budget/Mid-Range/Upscale/Luxury)
- `value_score` (reviews per $100)
- `value_category` (Low Value/Good Value/Excellent Value)

**Booking Patterns (2):**
- `stay_length_category` (Nightly/Weekly/Monthly/Long-term)
- `flexibility_score` (1-10, higher = more flexible)

## üéØ Key Findings (So Far)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Booking Flexibility is CRITICAL** 
| Stay Type | Avg Reviews/Month | Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Nightly | 2.10 | **3.75x more demand** |
| Weekly | 1.34 | Moderate demand |
| Monthly | 0.53 | Low demand |
| Long-term | 0.56 | Lowest demand |

**Insight:** Hosts accepting nightly bookings get 4x more bookings than long-term rentals.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Strong Seasonality Pattern Exists**
| Season | Nightly Reviews/Month | Weekly Reviews/Month |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Summer | 2.25 | 1.47 |
| Winter | 2.28 | 1.42 |
| Fall | 0.55 | 0.37 |
| Spring | TBD | TBD |

**Insight:** Summer and Winter are peak seasons. Fall has lowest demand (~4x lower).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Price Has NO Impact on Demand**
- Budget ($50-340): 1.39 reviews/month
- Mid-Range ($341-626): 1.41 reviews/month
- Upscale ($627-914): 1.37 reviews/month
- Luxury ($915-1200): 1.41 reviews/month

**Insight:** Price tier doesn't determine success. Location and seasonality matter more.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Correlation Analysis**
| Feature | Correlation | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| flexibility_score | 0.314 | Strong |
| value_score | 0.562 | Strong |
| demand_score | 0.834 | Strong |
| minimum_nights | -0.190 | Negative (less flexible = fewer bookings) |
| price | 0.004 | **None!** |
